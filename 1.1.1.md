# neo_sftp 1.1.1 – Concatenation splits & installer compatibility

- Added support for **Switch concatenation files** on split WebDAV downloads:
  - After downloading a large NSP in split mode (`<name>.nsp/00, 01, …`), neo_sftp now calls `fsdevSetConcatenationFileAttribute` on the `<name>.nsp` folder.
  - Horizon OS, DBI and Tinfoil can now see that folder as a **single logical NSP**, with the parts concatenated under the hood, so you can install large games from FAT32 SD cards.
- Fixed WebDAV path decoding so `+` characters in filenames are preserved correctly (no more `[B+U393216+16DLC].nsp` turning into a path with spaces).
- Refined WebDAV auto‑retry behaviour:
  - Failed downloads on the main connection are auto‑retried up to **6 times**, with a total of ~20 seconds of backoff spread across those attempts, before showing the confirm dialog.
  - Keeps long queues moving through transient “Couldn’t connect to server” and similar network hiccups.
- Configuration updates:
  - `[Global] webdav_split_large` now defaults to `0` (full NSP) for exFAT setups, while still supporting explicit split mode (`webdav_split_large=1` or `force_fat32=1`) for FAT32 cards.
  - `webdav_downloads.md` documents the FAT32 vs exFAT behaviour, recommended settings, and how concatenation files make split NSPs installable on FAT32.
